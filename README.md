#  Minimum Spanning Tree
 
   Given a connected, undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is subgraph that is tree and connects all the vertices together.
   A single graph can have many different spanning trees. We can also assign a weight to each edge, which is a number representing
   how unfavorable it is, and use this to assign a weight to a spanning tree by computing the sum of the weights of the edges in that spanning tree.
   A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is then a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight or
   every other spanning tree. More generally, any undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is union
    of minimum spanning trees for its connected components.
